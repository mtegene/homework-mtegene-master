# Homework

Each student will have a private homework repository to share with
me. Clone it, do your homework, and push the results back to the
shared repository. I will then be able to pull your work, add
comments, and push the results back in the same way.

You can do your homework in the original .lean file, or in a separate
file (like "solutions1.lean"). In the latter case, don't forget to
"add" the new file to version control.

We can use this README file to exchange notes.
